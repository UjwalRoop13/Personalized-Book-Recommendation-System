# Personalized-Book-Recommendation-System
This project implements a personalized book recommendation system that predicts whether a user will like a book based on a combination of user preference history and book genre metadata. It follows a hybrid recommendation approach, integrating user-specific information with NLP-based content features to make data-driven recommendation decisions.
